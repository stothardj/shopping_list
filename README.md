## Shopping list

Simple shopping list building tool.

First, add recipes to the "recipes" folder. One ingredient per-line.

Run this from the commandline:

ruby shopping\_list.rb

Running "help" will list commands.

Use commands to build a shopping list then use "save" to write it to a file.

I recommend copy+pasting that file into a Google Keep checkbox list.
